# Market-Basket-Analysis-with-Mock-Order-Dataset

*I. Overview*
- In my project, I performed Market Basket Analysis using Python and Tableau, leveraging a mock dataset that I generated, cleaned and standardized beforehand using Python. 
- Market Basket Analysis is a crucial technique for understanding customer purchase behavior, optimizing sales strategies, and improving profitability in retail settings.

Key Concepts Covered:

a) Market Basket Analysis: 
- I applied Market Basket Analysis to uncover associations between products frequently purchased together. 
- This insight informs decisions on cross-selling, promotions, and store layout optimizations.

b) Business Implications: 
- Understanding product correlations guided my decisions in designing effective sales promotions. 
- For instance, if customers often bought item A with item B, offering discounts on both simultaneously might not maximize revenue.

c) Dataset Preparation: 
- Before importing into Tableau, I cleaned and standardized the mock dataset in Python. 
- This preprocessing ensured data readiness for analysis, showcasing real-world data challenges and solutions.

d) Preliminary MBA: 
I performed the Market Basket Analysis prelimariliy in python, with pivot table, heatmaps.
- Importing the cleaned dataset.
- Utilizing plots and table to highlight which categories frequently co-occur (occur together) in customer orders.

e) Verified those insights with Tableau visual:
- Constructing a correlation matrix by placing categories on both rows and columns.
- Using metrics like count of orders to quantify the strength of associations.
- Customizing visuals for clarity and insight, such as adjusting labels and enhancing color coding.

f) Documented findings and recommendations:
